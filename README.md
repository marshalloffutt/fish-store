# Fish Store

## Description
This was an in-class code-along exercise where we created an entirely underwhelming fish store. Once the page loads, the user is able to:
  - See all the fish that are available in the store.
  - Apply a filter to see only the fish that are on sale.
  - Add fish to their basket
  - Remove fish from their basket.
  
The interesting thing about this project was that it served as our first introduction to [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to do all of the DOM interaction, thus unshackling us from the constraints of vanilla JavaScript.
